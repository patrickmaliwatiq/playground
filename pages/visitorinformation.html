<h3><a name="whatshouldiexpect">What should I expect?</a></h3>
<p>We give praise to Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour, through music, prayer and fellowship.  We practice giving and sharing through a weekly offering to support the work of the church.</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="whatshouldiwear">What should I wear to a Sunday service?</a></h3>
<p>There is no dress code at our church.  Wear what is comfortable!</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="canibringmychildren">Can I bring my children?</a></h3>
<p>Absolutely!  Following the offering in the morning service, children 3-11 years are invited to go upstairs to the multi-purpose room where we've planned Bible lessons, activities, crafts, and a snack just for them! After the service is over, parents are then asked to please pick up their children.  Grades 7-9 will have a class in the teen room and children 3 and under are welcome in the Nursery.</p>
<br/>
<h3><a name="howdoigetinvolved">How do I get involved with CHT?</a></h3>
<p>There are countless ways you can help!  The best way to begin is to ask one of our staff members of the opportunities and places to serve.</p>
